# tropycal
Python implementation of tropical algebra objects.

# About
Tropical algebra is a mathematical theory of algebraic structures which differ from the algebra of real numbers, by changing the binary operators of $\otimes = +$ and $\oplus = \max$ (or $\oplus = \min$). The tropical algebraic structure is not a field, it is a semi-field.

# TODO:
- [ ] Add documentation for the tropical algebra objects
- [ ] Add identities/units
- [ ] Add more examples
- [ ] Eigenvalues/vectors
